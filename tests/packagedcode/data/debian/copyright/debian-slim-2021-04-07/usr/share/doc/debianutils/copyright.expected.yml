      \ (C)  1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n  Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald S. Karr\n\
      \  Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n \n  Everyone is permitted to\
      \ copy and distribute verbatim copies\n  of this license, but changing it is not allowed.\
      \  You can also\n  use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n \n   The license\
      \ agreements of most software companies keep you at the\n mercy of those companies.  By\
      \ contrast, our general public license is\n intended to give everyone the right to share\
      \ SMAIL.  To make sure that\n you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make\
      \ restrictions\n that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\n\
      \ the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n \n   Specifically, we want to make sure\
      \ that you have the right to give\n away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code\
      \ or else can get it\n if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in\
      \ new\n free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n \n   To make sure\
      \ that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\n deprive anyone else of these\
      \ rights.  For example, if you distribute\n copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients\
      \ all the rights that you\n have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get\
      \ the\n source code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n \n   Also, for our own protection,\
      \ we must make certain that everyone\n finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.\
      \  If SMAIL is modified by\n someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\
      \ that what\n they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced\n\
      \ by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n \n   Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll\
      \ and Ronald S. Karr) make the following \n terms which say what you must do to be allowed\
      \ to distribute or change \n SMAIL.\n \n \n \t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n \n   1. You may copy\
      \ and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code\n as you receive it, in any medium,\
      \ provided that you conspicuously and\n appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright\
      \ notice \"Copyright\n (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\" (or with whatever\
      \ year is\n appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\n License\
      \ Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\n other recipients of the\
      \ SMAIL program a copy of this License\n Agreement along with the program.  You may charge\
      \ a distribution fee\n for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n \n   2. You may\
      \ modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,\n and copy and distribute\
      \ such modifications under the terms of\n Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do\
      \ the following:\n \n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n\
      \     that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n \n     b) cause the\
      \ whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n     that in whole or in part contains\
      \ or is a derivative of SMAIL or\n     any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to\
      \ all third\n     parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    \
      \ Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n     warranty protection\
      \ to some or all third parties, at your option).\n \n     c) You may charge a distribution\
      \ fee for the physical act of\n     transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer\
      \ warranty\n     protection in exchange for a fee.\n \n Mere aggregation of another unrelated\
      \ program with this program (or its\n derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution\
      \ medium does not bring\n the other program under the scope of these terms.\n \n   3.\
      \ You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,\n under Paragraph\
      \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
      \ that you also do one of the following:\n \n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding\
      \ machine-readable\n     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n \
      \    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid\
      \ for at least three\n     years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n\
      \     shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n     corresponding source\
      \ code, to be distributed under the terms of\n     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n\
      \     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n     corresponding\
      \ source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n     allowed only for non-commercial\
      \ distribution and only if you\n     received the program in object code or executable\
      \ form alone.)\n \n For an executable file, complete source code means all the source\
      \ code for\n all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\n\
      \ source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\n operating\
      \ system on which the executable file runs.\n \n   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute\
      \ or transfer SMAIL\n except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any\
      \ attempt\n otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and\n\
      \ your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be\n automatically\
      \ terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\n software programs from you\
      \ with this License Agreement will not have\n their licenses terminated so long as such\
      \ parties remain in full compliance.\n \n   5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL\
      \ into other free\n programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon\n\
      \ Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51\n Franklin St, Fifth\
      \ Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet\n worked out a simple rule that\
      \ can be stated here, but we will often\n permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals\
      \ of preserving the\n free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\n\
      \ the sharing and reuse of software.\n \n Your comments and suggestions about our licensing\
      \ policies and our\n software are welcome!  This contract was based on the contract made\
      \ by\n the Free Software Foundation.  Please contact the Free Software\n Foundation, Inc.,\
      \ 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,\n USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for\
      \ details on copylefted material in\n general.\n \n \t\t       NO WARRANTY\n \n   BECAUSE\
      \ SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO\n WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT\
      \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON\
      \ CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR AND/OR\n OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
      \ OF ANY KIND,\n EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n\
      \ WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n THE ENTIRE RISK\
      \ AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH\n YOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE,\
      \ YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n   IN NO\
      \ EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &\n RONALD S. KARR AND/OR\
      \ ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE\n SMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\
      \ TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
      \ OR\n CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n (INCLUDING BUT\
      \ NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
      \ BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\n PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL,\
      \ EVEN IF YOU HAVE\n BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM\
      \ BY\n ANY OTHER PARTY."
