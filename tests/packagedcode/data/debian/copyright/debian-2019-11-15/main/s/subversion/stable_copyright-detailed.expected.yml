          This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
          work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
          has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright
          notice for the Original Work:

              Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0

           1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
              royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
              duration of the copyright, to do the following:
              a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
                 part of a collective work;
              b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
                 Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative
                 Works") based upon the Original Work;
              c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
                 Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your
                 choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions,
                 including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this
                 Academic Free License;
              d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
              e) to display the Original Work publicly.

           2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
              royalty-free, non- exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
              claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
              the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration
              of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and
              import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

           3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
              preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
              and all available documentation describing how to modify the
              Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
              of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
              the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
              right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
              copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
              calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
              as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

           4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
              the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of
              their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
              promote products derived from this Original Work without express
              prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated
              herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's
              trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
              intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
              sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any
              patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section
              2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
              such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this
              License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
              under terms different from this License any Original Work that
              Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

           5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
              distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
              Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works
              may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are
              distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as
              an application intended for use over a network. As an express
              condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
              External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative
              Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

           6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
              Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or
              trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as
              well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
              identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the
              Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
              prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
              recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

           7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
              warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
              patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor
              or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the
              permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent
              rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
              sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
              "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
              including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
              merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
              RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.  This
              DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
              License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
              License except under this disclaimer.

           8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
              theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
              otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
              indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
              character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
              Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
              goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
              and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
              liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
              such limitation.

           9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly
              assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and
              irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
              conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
              Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
              effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
              recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
              your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1,
              including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
              Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
              conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international
              treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright
              exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair
              dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no
              longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
              upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

          10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
              automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
              granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
              action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor
              or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
              patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
              alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work
              with other software or hardware.

          11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
              to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
              jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
              conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
              jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
              application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
              Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
              termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
              copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This
              section shall survive the termination of this License.

          12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this
              License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
              shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
              without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred
              in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
              action. This section shall survive the termination of this
              License.

          13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
              unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
              necessary to make it enforceable.

          14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
              License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
              legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
              the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any
              entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
              with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the
              power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
              such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
              of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
              beneficial ownership of such entity.

          15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
              otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
              Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
              uses by You.

          16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005
              Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or
