      As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part
      or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under
      terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser
      generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser
      skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser
      skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special
      exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting Bison output
      files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without this

      is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
      and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
      with [Digium], [Inc]. If you obtained [Asterisk] under the GPL, then the GPL
      applies to all loadable [Asterisk] modules used on your system as well,
      except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
      source tree in the file COPYING.

      This package also includes various components that are not part of
      [Asterisk] itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
      and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
      GPL version 2 as well.

      [Digium], [Inc]. ([formerly] [Linux] [Support] [Services]) holds copyright
      and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the [Asterisk]
      package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
      for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or
      Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at
      runtime with the portions of [Asterisk] which fall under our
      copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible
      licenses than GPL.

      If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
      there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
      GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for [Asterisk] we
      would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).

      Specific permission is also granted to link [Asterisk] [with] [OpenSSL], [OpenH323]
      [and]/[or] [the] [UW] [IMAP] [Toolkit] and distribute the resulting binary files.

      In addition, [Asterisk] [implements] [two] [management]/[control] [protocols]: [the]
      [Asterisk] [Manager] [Interface] ([AMI]) [and] [the] [Asterisk] [Gateway] [Interface]
      ([AGI]). [It] [is] [our] [belief] [that] [applications] [using] [these] [protocols] [to]
      [manage] [or] [control] [an] [Asterisk] instance do not have to be licensed
      under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols
      do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,
      should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do
      fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to
      use these protocols in combination with [Asterisk] in external
      applications licensed under any license you wish.

      The '[Asterisk]' name and logos are trademarks owned by [Digium], [Inc].,
      and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
      wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
      redistribution of [Asterisk] source code obtained from [Digium], you
      should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
      steps you must take.

      File lacks copyright and licensing, but contains the comment
      "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it" which
      might be interpreted as a copyright holder not granting a license.
      More likely, however, the header file is considered non-copyrightable
      header with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:

       * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1 (according to git sources),
         together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment but
         also explicit copyright and licensing:
         <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.

       * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999 (according to git sources),
         at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it> released
         audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
