          This imagemap module started as a port of the original imagemap.c
          written by Rob McCool (11/13/93 robm@ncsa.uiuc.edu).
          This version includes the mapping algorithms found in version 1.3
          of imagemap.c.

          Contributors to this code include:

          Kevin Hughes, kevinh@pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu

          Eric Haines, erich@eye.com
          "macmartinized" polygon code copyright 1992 by Eric Haines, erich@eye.com

          Randy Terbush, randy@zyzzyva.com
          port to Apache module format, "base_uri" and support for relative URLs

          James H. Cloos, Jr., cloos@jhcloos.com
          Added point datatype, using code in NCSA's version 1.8 imagemap.c
          program, as distributed with version 1.4.1 of their server.
          The point code is originally added by Craig Milo Rogers, Rogers@ISI.Edu

          Nathan Kurz, nate@tripod.com
          Rewrite/reorganization.  New handling of default, base and relative URLs.
          New Configuration directives:
             ImapMenu {none, formatted, semiformatted, unformatted}
             ImapDefault {error, nocontent, referer, menu, URL}
             ImapBase {map, referer, URL}
          Support for creating non-graphical menu added.  (backwards compatible):
             Old:  directive URL [x,y ...]
             New:  directive URL "Menu text" [x,y ...]
              or:  directive URL x,y ... "Menu text"
          Map format and menu concept courtesy Joshua Bell, jsbell@acs.ucalgary.ca.

          Mark Cox, mark@ukweb.com, Allow relative URLs even when no base specified

          As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
            part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
            under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
            parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
            as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
            the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
            special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
            Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
            License without this special exception.
            .
            This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
            version 2.2 of Bison.  */
