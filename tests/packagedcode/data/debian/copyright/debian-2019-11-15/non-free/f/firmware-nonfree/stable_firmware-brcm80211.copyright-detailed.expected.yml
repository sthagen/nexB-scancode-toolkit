      \ valuable confidential information, but in no event less than\n reasonable diligence.\
      \  Information shall not be considered Confidential\n Information if and to the extent\

      \ ON\n ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING\n NEGLIGENCE)\
      \ OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT\n LIMITED TO LOSS OF\
      \ PROFITS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN\
      \ NO EVENT WILL BROADCOM’S LIABILITY WHETHER IN\n CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),\
      \ OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY\n LICENSEE FOR SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\
      \  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY\n NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF\
      \ ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\n \n 7.\tMISCELLANEOUS\n \n 7.1.\tExport Regulations. YOU UNDERSTAND\

      \ LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE\n TO CUBA, IRAN,\
      \ NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED.\n \n 7.2\tAssignment. This Agreement shall\
      \ be binding upon and inure to the\n benefit of the parties and their respective successors\
      \ and assigns, provided,\n however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any\
      \ rights or obligation\n hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise,\
      \ without\n the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall\n\
      \ be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to\n a successor\
      \ to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this\n Agreement relates\
      \ that is not a competitor of Broadcom.\n \n 7.3.\tGoverning Law; Venue.  This Agreement\
      \ shall be governed by the laws of\n California without regard to any conflict-of-laws\
      \ rules, and the United Nations\n Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\
      \ Goods is hereby excluded.\n The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the\
      \ subject matter\n hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County\
      \ of Orange,\n California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.\n\
      \ \n 7.4.\tSeverability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if\n possible,\
      \ be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any\n term or provision\
      \ of this Agreement is found by a court of competent\n jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable,\
      \ the validity or enforceability of\n the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected\
      \ if the illegal or\n unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of\
      \ this\n Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the\n\
      \ intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become\n terminated.\n\
      \ \n 7.5.\tEquitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this\n Agreement\
      \ would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that\n may be difficult\
      \ to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.\n Accordingly, Licensee agrees\
      \ that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and\n obtain immediate injunctive relief\
      \ to enforce obligations under the Agreement\n in addition to any other rights and remedies\
      \ it may have.\n \n 7.6.\tWaiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or\
      \ default\n hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach\
      \ or\n default.\n \n 7.7.\tEntire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement\n\
      \ between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and\n representations\
      \ between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.\n This Agreement may\
      \ be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in\n writing."
