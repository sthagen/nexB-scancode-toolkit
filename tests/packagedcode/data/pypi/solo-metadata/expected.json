      "description": "ScanCode is a tool to scan code for license, copyright, package and their documented dependencies and other interesting facts.\n================\nScanCode toolkit\n================\n\nA typical software project often reuses hundreds of third-party packages.\nLicense and origin information is not always easy to find and not normalized:\nScanCode discovers and normalizes this data for you.\n\nRead more about ScanCode here: `scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io \n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nCheck out the code at https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit\n\n\nWhy use ScanCode?\n=================\n\n- As a **standalone command-line tool**, ScanCode is **easy to install**, run,\n  and embed in your CI/CD processing pipeline.\n  It runs on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.\n\n- ScanCode is **used by several projects and organizations** such as\n  the `Eclipse Foundation <https://www.eclipse.org>`_,\n  `OpenEmbedded.org <https://www.openembedded.org>`_,\n  the `FSFE <https://www.fsfe.org>`_,\n  the `FSF <https://www.fsf.org>`_,\n  `OSS Review Toolkit <http://oss-review-toolkit.org>`_, \n  `ClearlyDefined.io <https://clearlydefined.io/>`_,\n  `RedHat Fabric8 analytics <https://github.com/fabric8-analytics>`_,\n  and many more.\n\n- ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, package manifests, direct dependencies,\n  and more both in **source code** and **binary** files and is considered as the\n  best-in-class and reference tool in this domain, re-used as the core tools for\n  software composition data collection by several open source tools.\n\n- ScanCode provides the **most accurate license detection engine** and does a\n  full comparison (also known as diff or red line comparison) between a database\n  of license texts and your code instead of relying only on approximate regex\n  patterns or probabilistic search, edit distance or machine learning.\n\n- Written in Python, ScanCode is **easy to extend with plugins** to contribute\n  new and improved scanners, data summarization, package manifest parsers, and\n  new outputs.\n\n- You can save your scan results as **JSON, HTML, CSV or SPDX** or create your\n  own format with Jinja templates.\n\n- You can also organize and run ScanCode server-side with the\n  companion `ScanCode.io web app <https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io>`_\n  to organize and store multiple scan projects including scripted scanning pipelines.\n\n- ScanCode is **actively maintained**, has a **growing users and contributors\n  community**.\n\n- ScanCode is heavily **tested** with an automated test suite of over **20,000 tests**.\n\n- ScanCode has an extensive and growing documentation.\n\n- ScanCode can process these packages, build manifest and lockfile formats to extract metadata:\n  Alpine packages, BUCK files, ABOUT files, Android apps, Autotools, Bazel, \n  JavaScript Bower, Java Axis, MS Cab, Rust Cargo, Chef Chrome apps, \n  PHP Composer and composer.lock, Conda, CPAN, Debian, Apple dmg,\n  Java EAR, WAR, JAR, FreeBSD packages, Rubygems gemspec, Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, \n  Go modules, Haxe packages, InstallShield installers, iOS apps, ISO images, \n  Apache IVY, JBoss Sar, R CRAN, Apache Maven, Meteor, Mozilla extensions, \n  MSI installers, JavaScript npm packages, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, \n  NSIS Installers, NugGet, OPam, Cocoapods, Python PyPI setup.py, setup.cfg, and \n  several related lockfile formats, semi structured README\n  files such as README.android, README.chromium, README.facebook, README.google,\n  README.thirdparty, RPMs, Shell Archives, Squashfs images, Java WAR, Windows executables.\n\n\nSee our `roadmap <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/roadmap.html>`_\nfor upcoming features.\n\n\nBuild and tests status\n======================\n\nWe run tests on multiple CIs to ensure a good platform compabitility and on\nmultiple version of Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\n+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n| **Appveyor** | **Azure**    | **RTD Build**|\n+==============+==============+==============+\n| |appveyor|   |    |azure|   | |docs-rtd|   |\n+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe ScanCode documentation is hosted at `scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nIf you are new to Scancode, start `here <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/newcomer.html>`_.\n\nOther Important Documentation Pages:\n\n- A `synopsis <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html>`_ \n  of ScanCode command line options.\n\n- Tutorials on:\n\n  -

This means installing Python (Python 3.6 or higher is required).\n\nSee `prerequisites <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#prerequisites>`_\nfor detailed information on the support platforms and Python versions.\n\nThere are a few common ways to `install ScanCode <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html>`_.\n\n- `*Recommended* installation as an application: Download a release archive, extract and run.\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-as-an-application-downloading-releases>`_\n\n- `Development installation from source code using a git clone\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-from-source-code-git-clone>`_\n\n- `Development installation as a library with \"pip install scancode-toolkit\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#pip-install>`_\n\n- `Run in a Docker container with a git clone and \"docker run\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-via-docker>`_\n\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nNote the `commands variation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#commands-variation>`_\nacross installation methods and platforms.\n\nYou can run an example scan printed on screen as JSON::\n\n    ./scancode -clip --json-pp - samples\n\nFollow the `How to Run a Scan <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html>`_\ntutorial to perform a basic scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed by\ndefault with Scancode.\n\nSee more command examples::\n\n    ./scancode --examples\n\nSee `How to select what will be detected in a scan\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_set_what_will_be_detected_in_a_scan.html>`_\nand `How to specify the output format <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_format_scan_output.html>`_\nfor more information.\n\nYou can also refer to the `command line options synopsis\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html>`_\nand an exhaustive list of `all available command line options\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html>`_.\n\n\nArchive extraction\n==================\n\nBy default ScanCode does not extract files from tarballs, zip files, and\nother archives as part of the scan. The archives that exist in a codebase\nmust be extracted before running a scan: `extractcode` is a bundled utility\nbehaving as a mostly-universal archive extractor. For example, this command will\nrecursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract\ndirectory::\n\n    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2\n\nSee `all extractcode options <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html#all-extractcode-options>`_\nand `how to extract archives <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_extract_archives.html>`_ for details.\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues\n\nFor discussions and chats, we have:\n\n* an official Gitter channel for `web-based chats\n  <https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss>`_.\n  Gitter is also accessible via an `IRC bridge <https://irc.gitter.im/>`_.\n  There are other AboutCode project-specific channels available there too.\n\n* an official `#aboutcode` IRC channel on liberachat (server web.libera.chat).\n  This channel receives build and commit notifications and can be noisy.\n  You can use your favorite IRC client or use the `web chat \n  <https://web.libera.chat/?#aboutcode>`_.\n\n\nSource code and downloads\n=========================\n\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git\n* https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Apache-2.0 as the overall license\n* CC-BY-4.0 for reference datasets (initially was in the Public Domain).\n* Multiple other secondary permissive or copyleft licenses (LGPL, MIT,\n  BSD, GPL 2/3, etc.) for third-party components.\n\n\nSee the NOTICE file and the .ABOUT files that document the origin and license of\nthe third-party code used in ScanCode for more details.\n\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4webymu0l2ip8utr?svg=true\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/nexB/scancode-toolkit\n    :alt: Appveyor tests status (Windows)\n\n.. |azure| image:: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_apis/build/status/nexB.scancode-toolkit?branchName=develop\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop\n    :alt: Azure tests status (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n.. |docs-rtd| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scancode-toolkit/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status",

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

`How to run a scan <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html>`_\n  - `How to visualize scan results <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_visualize_scan_results.html>`_\n\n- An exhaustive list of `all available options <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html>`_\n\n- Documentation on `Contributing to Code Development <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/contrib_dev.html>`_\n\n- Documentation on `Plugin Architecture <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/plugin_arch.html>`_\n\n- `FAQ <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/faq.html>`_\n\nSee also https://aboutcode.org for related companion projects and tools.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBefore installing ScanCode make sure that you have installed the prerequisites\nproperly. This means installing Python (Python 3.6 or higher is required).\n\nSee `prerequisites <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#prerequisites>`_\nfor detailed information on the support platforms and Python versions.\n\nThere are a few common ways to `install ScanCode <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html>`_.\n\n- `*Recommended* installation as an application: Download a release archive, extract and run.\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-as-an-application-downloading-releases>`_\n\n- `Development installation from source code using a git clone\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-from-source-code-git-clone>`_\n\n- `Development installation as a library with \"pip install scancode-toolkit\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#pip-install>`_\n\n- `Run in a Docker container with a git clone and \"docker run\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-via-docker>`_\n\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nNote the `commands variation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#commands-variation>`_\nacross installation methods and platforms.\n\nYou can run an example scan printed on screen as JSON::\n\n    ./scancode -clip --json-pp - samples\n\nFollow the `How to Run a Scan <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html>`_\ntutorial to perform a basic scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed by\ndefault with Scancode.\n\nSee more command examples::\n\n    ./scancode --examples\n\nSee `How to select what will be detected in a scan\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_set_what_will_be_detected_in_a_scan.html>`_\nand `How to specify the output format <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_format_scan_output.html>`_\nfor more information.\n\nYou can also refer to the `command line options synopsis\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html>`_\nand an exhaustive list of `all available command line options\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html>`_.\n\n\nArchive extraction\n==================\n\nBy default ScanCode does not extract files from tarballs, zip files, and\nother archives as part of the scan. The archives that exist in a codebase\nmust be extracted before running a scan: `extractcode` is a bundled utility\nbehaving as a mostly-universal archive extractor. For example, this command will\nrecursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract\ndirectory::\n\n    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2\n\nSee `all extractcode options <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html#all-extractcode-options>`_\nand `how to extract archives <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_extract_archives.html>`_ for details.\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues\n\nFor discussions and chats, we have:\n\n* an official Gitter channel for `web-based chats\n  <https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss>`_.\n  Gitter is also accessible via an `IRC bridge <https://irc.gitter.im/>`_.\n  There are other AboutCode project-specific channels available there too.\n\n* an official `#aboutcode` IRC channel on liberachat (server web.libera.chat).\n  This channel receives build and commit notifications and can be noisy.\n  You can use your favorite IRC client or use the `web chat \n  <https://web.libera.chat/?#aboutcode>`_.\n\n\nSource code and downloads\n=========================\n\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git\n* https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Apache-2.0 as the overall license\n* CC-BY-4.0 for reference datasets (initially was in the Public Domain).\n* Multiple other secondary permissive or copyleft licenses (LGPL, MIT,\n  BSD, GPL 2/3, etc.) for third-party components.\n\n\nSee the NOTICE file and the .ABOUT files that document the origin and license of\nthe third-party code used in ScanCode for more details.\n\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4webymu0l2ip8utr?svg=true\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/nexB/scancode-toolkit\n    :alt: Appveyor tests status (Windows)\n\n.. |azure| image:: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_apis/build/status/nexB.scancode-toolkit?branchName=develop\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop\n    :alt: Azure tests status (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n.. |docs-rtd| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scancode-toolkit/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status",
