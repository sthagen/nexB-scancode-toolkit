_Description: Really perform FusionDirectory major version upgrade?
 You are about to upgrade FusionDirectory to a new major version.
 Please consult the UPGRADE documentation first:
 /usr/share/doc/fusiondirectory/UPGRADE.md.gz
 .
 FusionDirectory comes with tools to migrate from one major version to
 another. However, as with other LDAP directory setups, exceptional
 circumstances or wrong data in the LDAP tree may sometimes prevent these
 tools from migrating everything.
 .
 In this case, the directory information tree may even need to be
 manually adapted outside of FusionDirectory with tools such as
 ldapmodify or ldapvi.
 .
 If you do not choose to proceed, the upgrade process for
 FusionDirectory related packages will be canceled.
