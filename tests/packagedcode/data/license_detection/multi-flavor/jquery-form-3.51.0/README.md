#[jQuery Form Plugin](http://jquery.malsup.com/form/)

##Overview
The jQuery Form Plugin allows you to easily and unobtrusively upgrade HTML forms to use AJAX.  The main methods, ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit, gather information from the form element to determine how to manage the submit process. Both of these methods support numerous options which allows you to have full control over how the data is submitted. 

No special markup is needed, just a normal form.  Submitting a form with AJAX doesn't get any easier than this!


##Copyright and License

* [MIT](http://malsup.github.com/mit-license.txt)
* [GPL](http://malsup.github.com/gpl-license-v2.txt)

You may use either license.  The MIT License is recommended for most projects because it is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the plugin.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use the plugin under that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use the jQuery Form Plugin in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.
