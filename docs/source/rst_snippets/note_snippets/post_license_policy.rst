.. note::

    The ``--license-policy`` option does not have any required CLI
    options, but you would not have any usable information if you are
    using it without the ``--license`` option since this only gets
    license keys from the file license detections. We do not have
    licenses as a required option because this plugin would be
    upgraded to also include the license policy attribute for
    packages too.
