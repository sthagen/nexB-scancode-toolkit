* Subject: {{public domain}} AT&T getopt source
  * Here's something you've all been waiting for:  the AT&T {{public domain}}
  * source for getopt(3).  It is the code which was given out at the 1985
  * UNIFORUM conference in Dallas.  I obtained it by electronic mail
  * directly from AT&T.  The people there assure me that it is indeed
  * {{in the public domain.}}
