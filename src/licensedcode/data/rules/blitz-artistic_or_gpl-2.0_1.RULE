The Blitz++ library is currently in transition from the GPL to the
more permissive "Blitz++ Artistic License".  Blitz++ is currently
distributed with both licenses, and you may pick either.  They
are detailed in GPL and LICENSE, respectively.  The artistic
license is appropriate for commercial use.
