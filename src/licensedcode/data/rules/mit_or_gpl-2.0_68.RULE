All versions, present and past, of the 
are {{dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses}}:

* [MIT](http://malsup.github.com/mit-license.txt)
* [GPL](http://malsup.github.com/gpl-license-v2.txt)

You may use either license.
The MIT License is recommended for most projects because
it is simple and easy to understand and it places almost
no restrictions on what you can do with the plugin.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also
free to use the plugin under that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose
one license or the other and you don't have to notify
anyone which license you are using.
You are free to use the jQuery Form Plugin in
commercial projects as long as the copyright header
is left intact.
