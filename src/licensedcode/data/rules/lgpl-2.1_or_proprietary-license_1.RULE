Licensing

Gensim is licensed under the OSI-approved GNU LGPLv2.1 license. This means that
it’s free for both personal and commercial use, but if you make any modification
to Gensim that you distribute to other people, you have to disclose the source code of these modifications.

Contact me if LGPL doesn’t fit your bill and you’d like the open source restrictions lifted.
